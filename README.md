Happiness Levels by Countries

Our Motivation
Mental health is an important part of overall health and well-being.  Health care professionals are interested in factors that influence and affect mental health from a psychological perspective.

We were interested in levels of perceived happiness in different countries and how that could affect healthy life expectancy.

Dataset used: World Happiness Report for 2023

Questions to Answer:

  Where are the happiest and least happiest countries in the world?
  
  Is there a correlation between high life expectancy and higher levels of happiness and what variables (social support, gov't corruption) strongly     contribute to that?
  
  From 2019 to 2022 do levels of happiness increase coming out of the pandemic in 2020?

The data set used to analyze happiness by country was a csv that had scores of happiness by countries from years 2005 - 2022

For the purposes of this project we only looked at years 2019 - 2022

Different variables that were measured by country were: life Ladder (happiness score; higher the better), GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

For the purposes on our analysis we focused on the correlation between Life ladder scores and life expectancy and what variables may affect this the most such as perceptions of corruption in governments, social support and freedom to make life choices.
