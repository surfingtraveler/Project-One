Happiness Levels by Countries

Questions to Answer:

•	Where are the happiest and least happiest countries in the world?

•	Is there a correlation between high life expectancy and higher levels of happiness and what variables (social support, gov't corruption) strongly contribute to that?

•	From 2019 to 2022 do levels of happiness increase coming out of the pandemic in 2020?

Our Motivation:
Mental health is an important part of overall health and well-being. Health care professionals are interested in factors that influence and affect mental health from a psychological and physical perspective.

We were interested in levels of perceived happiness in different countries and how that could affect healthy life expectancy.

Task Breakdown:

•	Organize and clean data

•	Analyze data create and create visualizations/maps, etc.

•	Conclusion on what variables affect happiness the most by country.

Conclusions and Summary:

For purposes of this analysis and presentation, we narrowed our variables to include only perceived levels of Government Corruption and Social Support and saw some strong correlation with Social Support and Happiness Scores. We also considered Life Expectancy and saw a strong correlation with Happiness Score.
We acknowledge there are many more variables that can influence the Happiness Score. Also, not everyone views the definition of happiness the same way. The World Happiness Report however, as noted by a publication titled "Happiness and Life Satisfaction":  is widely accepted as an effective means to measure people's perceptions of happiness.

As noted by a publication titled "Happiness and Life Satisfaction" :
Surveys asking people about life satisfaction and happiness do measure subjective well-being with reasonable accuracy.(1)

The "so what?" analysis point we concluded is we acknowledge that perceived levels of happiness vary by country with some at the higher ladder scores and others at lower end. Many factors go into influencing this Score and can lead to some surprising and some  not so surprising findings.
Specifically, in the Healthcare industry, there is increasing interest in happiness and mental health. Finding what variables drive and influence happiness is of growing importance for those that study this data.

Leads to how happiness levels can affect life expectancy.
Funding for mental health programs. Health care can derive valuable insights to learn more about happiness levels and driversbehind happiness both on a global and local level.
